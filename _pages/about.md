I love making new things for someone. Iâ€™m currently a senior student at Purdue University Fort Wayne. After I graduate with my computer science degree, I hope to work a full-time job as a software engineer. I took an interested in Web Development, Human-Computer Interaction, and the Software Engineering area. I love making changes to help people and making humans' life better. 

While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. I figured it would do just fine for my friend and I set about searching for a pretty theme. I wanted a theme with a _book-ish_ vibe. Unfortunately, most of the themes were too modern. Eventually, I caved and begun working on my own theme. With the help of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll Butler, I was able to build **Tale**.
