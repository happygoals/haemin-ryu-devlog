Hello! I'm Haemin and I currently graduated with my computer science degree at [Purdue University Fort Wayne](https://www.pfw.edu/). I'm a member of the [Association for Computing Machinary](https://www.acm.org/) and ACM PFW. I hope to work a full-time job as a software engineer. 

I took an interested in **Web Development**, **Human-Computer Interaction**, and the **Software Engineering area**. Software can provide tools to help people and to do many great things for the people in need. I love thinking about changes to make the user experience and humans' life better. I'm knowledgeable of architecture design best practices. I'm developing with the philosophy of making good products that do not give up even minor details.
