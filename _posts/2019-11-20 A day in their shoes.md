During the international Education Week, I could volunteer as a senior international student at PFW for the simulation being the officer in the screma national bank and for the panel discussion. 

_____________________

Dr. Amal Khalifa, a professor at the Computer Science department, was my co-worker of the simulation. 

Here is the instructions for the officer in the Acirema National Bank/ 

<b>Functions:</b>
  (1) Request to see admissions letter
  (2) Issue bank letters      
  
<b>Suggested Actions</b> 

    <b>Execution of Bank Statement</b>
    Upon request, issue a bnk statement for the student. Randomly pick the statement, you will have 3 options. One statement will be too old (dated December 2018), one will not show enough money (only $34,990).
    The other document will be recent and show enough money $35,000. 
    
    If a student was issued the statement which is too old or not enough money, they will be sent back to the bank to get an updated statement from the Purdue Fort Wayne School official. 
    
<b>Arbitrary Actions</b>

Place the "Closed for National Holiday" on your table at some point in the exercise, preferably when there is a line at your table. 
Get up and leave for three minutes; then return. 

Randomly pick people who are in the back of the line or in the middle and let them move to the front of the line and help them.
