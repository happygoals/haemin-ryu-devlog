**My 2019 year in review** 

2019 has been a year of ups and downs for me. The first quarter of 2019 was not so pleasant for me, but I was able to bounce back, turn things around and have a great year. I finally graduated this December 2019 as a Computer Science student at Purdue University Fort Wayne, at the same time, I got the bachelor of Computer Science degree from Seoul Women's University. 

At the beginning of the year, I was so frustrating from the things to do before I graduate, my goal was to be graduated and to become a better software developer. I got inspired from people around me, especially my capstone team members and the classmates, pushing me to greatness.

**Thankful moments of 2019**

#_Job searching as a software engineer_
<br>
I took a technical on-site interview sometime this year for a software position at a company. It was my first time interacting with the platform in the United States, I was used to Hackerrank mostly then. I did several coding challenge on Hackerrank. I mostly used Java for solving problems. At first, I got the zero percentage on the test and it made me motivated. After that, I started to study and strengthen my programming skill inclduing Data Structures and Algorithms, and I continued to review the solution of my coding challenge on Hackerrank with practice problems.

#_Senior year as a computer science student_
<br>
As the graduating semester is coming, I have found many opportunities I could reach out as an undergraduate CS student. Before I graduate, I no longer had much time being a college student and had no place to retreat anymore. To get more opportunities, I knocked on the door, step into the field, and took courage to find my own way.

#_Traveling in the US, Canada, and Cuba_
<br>
I traveled 11 different states(Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Wisconsin, California, Arizona, Nevada, Washinton, New York) in USA this year. Additionally, I went to Toronto, Canada like a little road trip for 3days. During spring break, I adventure to Cuba for a week. I had an excited year, I made such good friends around the US, I have learned  by traveling. I truly appreciate the time and circumtances that I was given.

#_Worship team member as a bassist_
<br>
I have played a bass guitar since 2014 and finally my dream came true. God always uses me in ways I never imagined. It was so grateful to play bass guitar at Hanmaum Church once a week with the best and the warmest worship team members. 

**Plans for 2020**

1. _Be an open-handed person_: Based on what I was given by people around me, I would like to share my knowleage and contribute to the community in 2020. I will be more involved in the software engineer, volunteer, and <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> community this upcoming year. If there's a chance, I would like to contribute to open source project. I'm interested in voluntarily research in Software engineering or <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> area. 
2. _Start writing regularly_:I'm looking to write way more than I did in 2019.
3. _Watch! Listen! Read!_
4. _Minimize_: I decided to practice a more empty~~but fullfiled!~~ life to be careful not to place greed and arrogance where love should be.
5. _Be more courage,  integrity, and courtesy_.

**In conclusion(Overall Vision)**

When I first came to the US, Iâ€™ve got confidence at college because I already knew the power of failures.
Today I had a flashback of all pictures from the start of my college life until this moment. I'm so sad to leave with millions of treasurable moments I had all these years. I'm much blessed to have learned something to live all my life.
Now I understand how much I have changed with spent time in college within laughs, tears, and stories. During college, I could find myself, my hidden talents, and the meaning of true friendship. No one could have survived their college life without their friends. I owe a lot of happiness here, and I'm deeply grateful for all the lessons I got from college.
One thing for sure is I will miss these college days and people. These are something to be proud of and meant to me. It's time to grow up to be a better and open-handed person!

Thank you for reading it and happy new 2020!
