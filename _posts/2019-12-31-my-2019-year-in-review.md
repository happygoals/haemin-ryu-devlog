# My 2019 year in review 

2019 has been a year of ups and downs for me. The first quarter of 2019 was not so pleasant for me, but I was able to bounce back, turn things around and have a great year. I finally graduated this December 2019 as a Computer Science student at Purdue University Fort Wayne, at the same time, I got the bachelor of Computer Science degree from Seoul Women's University. 

At the beginning of the year, I was so frustrating from the things to do before I graduate, my goal was to be graduated and to become a better software developer. I got inspired from people around me, especially my capstone team members and the classmates, pushing me to greatness.

## Work and Projects in 2019

### Work
#### Web Developer
As a Computer Science Temporary Web Administrator for 2 months(Nov 2019 – Dec 2019), I managed the CS Dept. & IAV Center website by revising contents with dotCMS, HTML/CSS/JS. 

#### Teaching Assistent
I assisted for CS36000 Software Engineering TA since September 2018 with Dr. Venkata (3 semesters). I was a TA for CS16000 Intro to Computer Science I - Java course during a Summer 1 semester with Dr. Liu. Mostly, I graded the assignments, projects, and quizzes and provided feedback for assignments, projects, and lab work. With Dr. Venkata, I reported some documentation for the course materials. These has been changed every semester. Besides, I Helped students during lab sessions, supplementary tutoring sessions, and anytime by email when they tried to solve the problems in Software Engineering. Through the TA job, I could go and visit one of the eminent Software Engineering conference(ASE2019) and I had a guest lecture to share the knowleadge I got from the conferece with Software Engineering students. 

#### CS Student Worker
In the CS department's office, I kept the CS Department office for a while when the secretary needed me, at the same time, I got a phone call and did some paperworks. Thanks to Kaye, I enjoyed a lot working and serving as a CS student worker in 2019.

I helped New Student Orientation at Department of Computer Science for Fall 2019. During summer, as a student worker, I guided new CS student to the tour of CS deparment(Labs -> Hallway -> Dept. Office -> IAV Center) with Introduction of CS department & Programs. I had presented the 'Introduction of class registration' and explained 'How to use myBLUEprint'. After completing academic advising survey, students needed to get an academic advising. When student tried to register their class, I taught them how to utilize the registration system for registering their courses. This experience improved my presentation skils to stand in front of the students. 


### Projects

#### Digital Harvest              	              
After I completed my senior design project, I produced much of the front-end code. As a part of the Department of Computer Science, Prof. Max Fowler and I moved forward into the actual development portion of a web application to help food growers through online market. The goal of the project was to navigate the student to learn how to develop an integrated web applicaiton using the tutorial 'DIGITAL HARVEST WEBSITE' and I was a responsiblity of the Front-end development part. 
I created the skeleton and main design of:
 - A registration page for buyers and sellers
 - A confirmation email page
 - A management products page for local growers
 - A sales list page to access and ship their sales for local growers
 - A product view page
 - A user settings
 - A payment detail page
 - A shopping cart page to buy multiple items.

#### Indoor Navigation: Improved Accessibility for People with Disabilities (Sponsered by Parkview Health)
During a year (May 2018 – Apr 2019), our team Developed a web application with data visualization and employee administration management systems. The primary purpose of this project is to improve upon the previous generation of the Indoor Navigation Mobile Application that was created for the Parkview Regional Medical Campus (PRMC) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. This project aims to utilize new technologies with a focus on the patient experience to keep PRMC ahead of the competitors. In our project, we have 3 different key parts, web development, targeted advertisements, and improved mobile application navigation. As a Front-end Lead Developer, I had focused on the web development to presents analyzed data and business analytics to administrative staff in a comprehensive manner. For example, using the webpage, the Parkview staff could determine what time are most populated, and by which age group or gender. This would allow for an in-depth look at particular patient demographics, giving Parkview the tools to improve upon their already great services.

Some of my responsibilities as a Front-end Lead Developer include:
- Architected, designed, and implemented web forms and user interfaces.
- Experienced in Angular 7, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript (MEAN Stack).
- Developed heatmap and routes chart with a visual approach for space utilization and created the registration systems with sign-up, sign-in, forgot-password, and settings pages. 
- Involved in all the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (RUP and Scrum).
- Had a scrum meeting regularly 2 times a week with Front-end team, (at least) 3 times a week with the entire team.

## Thankful Moments of 2019

### Job searching as a software engineer_
<br>
I took a technical on-site interview sometime this year for a software position at a company. It was my first time interacting with the platform in the United States, I was used to Hackerrank mostly then. I did several coding challenge on Hackerrank. I mostly used Java for solving problems. At first, I got the zero percentage on the test and it made me motivated. After that, I started to study and strengthen my programming skill inclduing Data Structures and Algorithms, and I continued to review the solution of my coding challenge on Hackerrank with practice problems. 
<br>

### Senior year as a computer science student_
<br>
As the graduating semester is coming, I have found many opportunities I could reach out as an undergraduate CS student. Before I graduate, I no longer had much time being a college student and had no place to retreat anymore. To get more opportunities, I knocked on the door, step into the field, and took courage to find my own way. I got Top 50 Awards as a representative of Computer Science student. I'm so proud of my team to complete the Capstone Design Project successfully. 
<br>

### Traveling in the US, Canada, and Cuba_
<br>
I traveled 11 different states(Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Wisconsin, California, Arizona, Nevada, Washinton, New York) in USA this year. Additionally, I went to Toronto, Canada like a little road trip for 3days. During spring break, I adventure to Cuba for a week. I had an excited year, I made such good friends around the US, I have learned  by traveling. I truly appreciate the time and circumtances that I was given. 
<br>

### Worship team member as a bassist_
<br>
I have played a bass guitar since 2014 and finally my dream came true. God always uses me in ways I never imagined. It was so grateful to play bass guitar at Hanmaum Church once a week with the best and the warmest worship team members. 
<br>

## Plans for 2020

1. _Be an open-handed person_: Based on what I was given by people around me, I would like to share my knowleage and contribute to the community in 2020. I will be more involved in the software engineer, volunteer, and <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> community this upcoming year. If there's a chance, I would like to contribute to open source project. I'm interested in voluntarily research in Software engineering or <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> area. 
2. _Start writing regularly_:I'm looking to write way more than I did in 2019.
3. _Watch! Listen! Read!_
4. _Minimize_: I decided to practice a more empty ~~but fullfiled!~~ life to be careful not to place greed and arrogance where love should be.
5. _Be more courage,  integrity, and courtesy_.

## In Conclusion - Overall Vision

When I first came to the US, I’ve got confidence at college because I already knew the power of failures.
Today I had a flashback of all pictures from the start of my college life until this moment. I'm so sad to leave with millions of treasurable moments I had all these years. I'm much blessed to have learned something to live all my life.
Now I understand how much I have changed with spent time in college within laughs, tears, and stories. During college, I could find myself, my hidden talents, and the meaning of true friendship. No one could have survived their college life without their friends. I owe a lot of happiness here, and I'm deeply grateful for all the lessons I got from college.
One thing for sure is I will miss these college days and people. These are something to be proud of and meant to me. It's time to grow up to be a better and open-handed person!

Thank you for reading it and happy new 2020!
