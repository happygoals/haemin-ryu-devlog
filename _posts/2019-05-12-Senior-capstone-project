Idea 1
Problem
Information in the database is not currently used.
Reason
Hospital patient’s location data can be efficiently managed to help guide patients, and also create targeted advertisement that increases Parkview’s revenue.
Solution
Development of a Web Application that presents analyzed data to administrative staff in a  comprehensive manner, and allowing the data to be manipulated or viewed in many different formats. 
The development of Targeted Advertisements on the mobile application using the analyzed data. (Define - ‘patient data’ and ‘targeted advertisements’)

Idea 6
Problem
Patients can get easily lost on Parkview’s campus, even with the provided map.
Reason
Parkview’s campus is huge, and consists of many locations.
Solution
Implement pictures and photospheres in the map which can help users identify where certain areas on the map are in real life.(Supplemental information)

Idea 7
Problem
Users may need help while traveling across Parkview, and may need medical assistance while doing so.
Reason
Many people at Parkview are sick, hurt, or are over encumbered, and may frequently need assistance. 
Solution
Implement a Help! Button which will alert Parkview’s staff to the user’s current location and request their assistance. Only works when on Parkview’s campus.

Idea 11
Problem
Patients who are blind or hard of sight will not be able to use the map effectively. 
Reason
The map will be very detailed and will be hard for some users to read. (Present with selling point)
Solution
Have a recorded voice within the program that will announce to the user when they enter certain buildings/areas. This can be toggled on and off.

Idea 13
Problem
The Mobile Application currently gathers small data but could be used to gather more information to assist the Parkview Staff.
Reason
This will help parkview better understand their patients and allow them to push their own products.
Solution
Development of OPT IN/OUT Surveys or Questions that can bolster the usefulness of the web application and targeted advertisements.

* Failed ideas: Create a link from the mobile device to an outside source that lights up and navigates the user in a different way, Have an sub map for each vertical level, and will update when the user goes up and down floors.
he application can give some useful information. For example, when patients get stye, the application shows “Lemon is good for your health….”. In this case, to get this information, the patients can input their diseases or we can suggest top 5 diseases on the application by recognizing where the patients are. 
, Create custom routing technology for wheelchair users. If a user using a wheelchair finds an obstacle directly, the position can be registered in the application, and a new route is set based on the position. Based on the collected data, it suggests a new route for wheelchair users.



## Beginning 2018

## Final 2018 
- Data Structure:
Our team create three different tables for web application. 
One of them is navigation mock data for data analytics. In this table, it has 5 different columns, ID, Time, Date, Beacon and Destination. We generate mock data for this table, because it is limited for data analytics to use and collect data from beacon at engineering building. we set route beacon under the beacon column and I’ll explain more about this later. 
The other two tables are for managing user account on web app. Once user create their userID, they need to prove EmployeeID which is already stored in Authorization table. Then, they can make their user account. 

* Heat map: 
Here is one of our data analytics named Heat map. we'll only focus on Parkview Cardiac department because it coincides with our project scope that we discuss with sponsors. we draw this map with reference with Parkview cardiac department, we then populate possible routes with beacons add destination beacons at each department and entrance. 

This is the example of beacon route set. First, we set possible route from entrance beacon to destination beacon. Then we draw the beacon route.
Each single beacon will have their own field, so that the number of visits can be stored from user’s passing by that specific beacons. Based on the specific field, we draw each beacon’s intensity on heat map. 
Parkview staff members can see which route has the most traffic or the least traffic based on time and date chose by them. 

And Heatmap.js is JavaScript library that we’ll use for viewing of data.
