# Plans for 2020

1. _Be an open-handed person_: Based on what I was given by people around me, I would like to share my knowleage and contribute to the community in 2020. I will be more involved in the software engineer, volunteer, and <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> community this upcoming year. If there's a chance, I would like to contribute to open source project. I'm interested in voluntarily research in Software engineering or <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> area. 
2. _Brand myself to shape the first and biggest expression of me_
3. _Start writing regularly_: I'm looking to write way more than I did in 2019.
4. _Watch! Listen! Read!_
5. _Minimize_: I decided to practice a more empty ~~but fullfiled!~~ life to be careful not to place greed and arrogance where love should be.
6. _Be more courage,  integrity, and courtesy_.
