## Questions that I asked my supervisor on the First Day of Internship

2. How can i be a valuable team member? 
3. How will I fit into the culture? 
4. What do you want me to achieve in this internship program?

I had watched the c# and .NET course video materials and implemented following projects. I simply went through the projects and use online resources to complete them as quickly as possible. My boss always welcomes to answer the questions and updated frequently the material and supplementary videos and slide. All employee are encouraged to have an hour training every morning. 

## Daily Scrum List

We had been having our January company event on Friday the 31st. Company ordered pizza from Olie's. It was quite fancy and nice. They put together rules for a little game competition. We were playing arcade games at the breakroom. It was such a cool thing that we have a gaming machine at workplace.
